responsible, a tech geek [thats what morningBrew.com greets me with]and independent worker with the
capacity to rapidly master new duties. I am outgoing and sociable, and I can work both within and outside
of a team. Being a member of numerous school groups and sports teams throughout my childhood has
taught me the value of collaboration and how four hands are better than two. Obtaining a job while

improve my skills. while(alive) [ keepLearning(); acceptChallenges(); takeRisk(); ];
